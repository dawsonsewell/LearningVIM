This is the README document I've created using VIM. 

To go into insert mode using VIM you need to type lower case "i". 

To exit insert mode you click the esc key. 

To save the file you type ":w" -- w stands for write 

To quit VIM you type ":q". -- q stands for quit. Now I know how to navigate vim. Append text, insert text, and delete text. 


I know how to navigate through words using 'web' w for next word at the start, e for next word at the end. And b for back a word.
